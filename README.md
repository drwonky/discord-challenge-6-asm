One Lone Coder Discord Programming Challenge #6 written in 64bit x86 assembly for Linux

This is essentially a port of the C++ version of this challenge to 64bit x86 assembly language, running on Linux.

The objective of this challenge was to learn AT&T syntax, since that is the most popular syntax (inline GCC) used with
Linux.  The second objective was to write assembly language on Linux.  I learned Intel syntax with TASM on DOS, but hadn't
done any assembly language on Linux.  This is my first 64bit assembly language too.
